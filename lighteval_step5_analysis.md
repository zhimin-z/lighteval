# LightEval - Step 5 Support Analysis

## Summary Table
| Process | Support Level | Evidence |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| S5P1 | 2 | Basic statistical aggregation via numpy functions and bootstrap stderr |
| S5P2 | 1 | Minimal stratification support through data filtering only |
| S5P3 | 0 | No built-in visualization capabilities |
| S5P4 | 0 | No performance-quality tradeoff analysis tools |
| S5P5 | 1 | Basic result comparison via result tables, no statistical testing |

## Detailed Analysis

### S5P1: Compute aggregate statistics
**Rating:** 2 (Partial Support)
**Evidence:**
- Statistical aggregation functions in `src/lighteval/metrics/utils/metric_utils.py` support `corpus_level_fn` with numpy functions like `np.mean`
- Bootstrap standard error computation in `src/lighteval/metrics/utils/stderr.py` includes `bootstrap_stderr()`, `mean_stderr()`, and `_stddev()` functions
- Corpus-level metrics in `src/lighteval/metrics/metrics_corpus.py` provide F1 scores, Matthews correlation coefficient
- Result aggregation examples in metrics definitions: `corpus_level_fn=np.mean` across many metrics
- Missing data handling appears limited - no specific utilities for outlier detection or robust statistics
**Limitations:**
- No built-in support for percentiles, median, or variance calculation beyond basic numpy functions
- No dedicated API for weighted aggregation beyond what numpy provides
- Limited robust statistics support - no outlier detection or missing value handling utilities
- No custom aggregation function framework beyond passing callable functions

### S5P2: Perform stratified analysis
**Rating:** 1 (Basic Support)
**Evidence:**
- Task configuration system in `docs/source/saving-and-reading-results.mdx` shows detailed logging with metadata through `__doc__` field containing task hyperparameters
- Result details saved as Parquet files with sample-level information: `details_{task}_{timestamp}.parquet`
- Loading framework supports filtering via pandas/datasets operations on saved details
- No built-in stratification utilities or group-by operations
**Limitations:**
- No dedicated APIs for demographic or domain-based slicing
- No built-in fairness metrics or bias analysis tools  
- No multi-dimensional stratification support
- Users must implement custom filtering and grouping logic
- No cross-tabulation utilities

### S5P3: Generate diagnostic visualizations
**Rating:** 0 (No Support)
**Evidence:**
- No visualization libraries imported or used in the codebase
- No plotting functionality found in source code examination
- No chart generation APIs or diagnostic visualization tools
- Search for "plot|visual|chart|graph|matplotlib|seaborn|plotly" returned minimal matches, mostly in task instructions
**Limitations:**
- No confusion matrix generation
- No ROC curve or precision-recall curve plotting
- No calibration plots or error distribution visualizations
- No interactive exploration tools
- Users must implement all visualization externally

### S5P4: Analyze performance-quality tradeoffs and failure patterns
**Rating:** 0 (No Support)
**Evidence:**
- No tradeoff analysis tools found in the codebase
- No performance profiling or latency measurement integration
- No error pattern detection or failure analysis modules
- No systematic failure identification tools
**Limitations:**
- No latency vs accuracy curve generation
- No root cause analysis capabilities
- No performance profiler integration
- No bias detection tools beyond basic metrics
- No failure pattern clustering or analysis

### S5P5: Rank and compare models against baselines
**Rating:** 1 (Basic Support)
**Evidence:**
- Basic result comparison via `make_results_table()` function in `src/lighteval/utils/utils.py` creates markdown tables
- Result structure in `docs/source/saving-and-reading-results.mdx` shows standardized format with metrics and stderr values
- Hub integration allows pushing results for sharing: `push_to_hub` functionality in `EvaluationTracker`
- Result loading supports comparison across different model runs
**Limitations:**
- No statistical significance testing for comparisons
- No automated leaderboard generation
- No baseline tracking or relative improvement metrics
- No ranking algorithms beyond manual table sorting
- Users must implement custom comparison logic and statistical tests

## Overall Assessment

LightEval is primarily focused on **evaluation execution and result collection** rather than comprehensive analysis. The framework excels at:

1. **Metrics computation**: Strong support for individual and corpus-level metrics
2. **Result tracking**: Comprehensive logging and storage of evaluation details
3. **Result sharing**: Integration with Hugging Face Hub and other platforms

However, it provides **minimal built-in analysis capabilities** for Step 5 processes. Users must rely on external tools for:

- Advanced statistical analysis
- Data visualization  
- Performance profiling
- Model comparison and ranking
- Bias and fairness analysis

The framework follows a **"compute and store, analyze elsewhere"** philosophy, making it more of an evaluation execution engine than a comprehensive analysis platform.
