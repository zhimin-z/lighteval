## Detailed Analysis

### S1P1: Define evaluation tasks and success criteria
**Rating:** 3
**Evidence:**
- **Custom Task Definition**: Comprehensive support through `LightevalTaskConfig` class in `src/lighteval/tasks/lighteval_task.py` with fields for name, prompt_function, metrics, dataset configuration, generation parameters
- **Task Registry**: Robust task registry system in `src/lighteval/tasks/registry.py` supporting multiple suites (helm, bigbench, harness, leaderboard, lighteval, original, extended, custom, test)
- **Success Criteria Configuration**: Rich metrics system in `src/lighteval/metrics/metrics.py` with 50+ built-in metrics including accuracy, F1, BLEU, ROUGE, perplexity, etc.
- **Task Templates**: Examples in `examples/custom_tasks_templates/` show how to create custom evaluation tasks with specific success criteria
- **Configuration Through Code**: Tasks defined as Python objects with full programmatic control over evaluation objectives

**Limitations:**
None significant - framework provides comprehensive task definition capabilities

### S1P2: Select evaluation methodologies
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- **Objective Metrics**: Extensive support for automatic metrics (accuracy, F1, BLEU, ROUGE, etc.) in `src/lighteval/metrics/metrics.py`
- **Evaluation Modes**: Support for batch evaluation through multiple backends (accelerate, vLLM, nanotron, endpoints)
- **LLM-as-Judge**: Built-in support for LLM judges in custom tasks (example in `examples/custom_tasks_templates/custom_yourbench_task.py` with `JudgeLLM` class)
- **Evaluation Paradigms**: Supports classification (`loglikelihood_acc`), generation (`generative` metrics), and ranking through different sampling methods in `src/lighteval/tasks/requests.py`
- **Pipeline Configuration**: Configurable through `PipelineParameters` in `src/lighteval/pipeline.py` with options for parallel processing

**Limitations:**
- Limited built-in human evaluation interfaces
- No explicit real-time evaluation mode (primarily batch-focused)
- Subjective assessment requires custom implementation

### S1P3: Choose appropriate datasets and benchmarks
**Rating:** 3
**Evidence:**
- **Standard Benchmarks**: Extensive support for 7000+ evaluation tasks including MMLU, HumanEval, GLUE, GSM8K, HellaSwag, TriviaQA, BigBench, HELM benchmarks (as stated in README.md)
- **Custom Datasets**: Full support for custom datasets through HuggingFace Hub integration in `LightevalTaskConfig` with `hf_repo`, `hf_subset` parameters
- **Dataset Registry**: Built-in task definitions in `src/lighteval/tasks/default_tasks.py` with hundreds of pre-configured tasks
- **Data Loaders**: Sophisticated data loading system in `src/lighteval/data.py` with dynamic batching and distributed sampling
- **Custom Dataset APIs**: Easy integration through `prompt_function` parameter allowing custom data preprocessing

**Limitations:**
- No built-in synthetic data generation capabilities
- Relies primarily on HuggingFace Hub for dataset hosting

### S1P4: Configure evaluation infrastructure
**Rating:** 3
**Evidence:**
- **Model Backends**: Comprehensive support for multiple backends:
  - HuggingFace Transformers (`main_accelerate.py`)
  - vLLM (`main_vllm.py`)
  - Nanotron for distributed training (`main_nanotron.py`)
  - SGLang (`main_sglang.py`)
  - Various endpoints (OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace Inference, TGI) via `main_endpoint.py`
- **Resource Management**: Built-in support for GPU allocation, batch sizing, parallel processing through `PipelineParameters`
- **Configuration Files**: YAML-based model configurations in `examples/model_configs/` for different backends
- **Containerization**: Support for Docker images and endpoint deployment through Inference Endpoints
- **Custom Models**: Support for completely custom model implementations through `main_custom.py`

**Limitations:**
None significant - comprehensive infrastructure support

### S1P5: Design evaluator pipeline
**Rating:** 3
**Evidence:**
- **Rule-based Evaluators**: Extensive built-in metrics for rule-based evaluation (exact match, F1, BLEU, etc.) in `src/lighteval/metrics/metrics_sample.py`
- **LLM-as-Judge**: Full support through `JudgeLLM` class with examples in custom tasks (`JudgeLLMYourBench` in `examples/custom_tasks_templates/custom_yourbench_task.py`)
- **Custom Evaluators**: Flexible metric system allowing custom evaluator implementation through metric groupings and corpus-level functions
- **Pipeline Design**: Sophisticated pipeline architecture in `src/lighteval/pipeline.py` with `Pipeline` class supporting parallel execution and custom evaluation flows
- **Metric Extensibility**: Easy extension of metrics through `extend_enum(Metrics, ...)` pattern

**Limitations:**
- Human-in-the-loop evaluation requires custom implementation

### S1P6: Set up security and resource constraints
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- **Resource Limits**: Sophisticated timeout system in `src/lighteval/utils/timeout.py` with platform-specific implementations (signal-based on Unix, multiprocessing on Windows)
- **Cache Management**: Built-in caching system in `src/lighteval/utils/cache_management.py` for efficient resource usage
- **Budget Constraints**: LiteLLM integration provides cost tracking capabilities for API-based models
- **Credential Management**: Integration with HuggingFace Hub authentication (`huggingface-cli login`) and environment variable support for API keys
- **Timeout Configuration**: Multiple timeout controls through `generation_size`, `stop_sequence`, and custom timeout decorators
- **Resource Allocation**: Comprehensive resource management through batch sizing, parallel processing, and dynamic batching in `src/lighteval/data.py`
- **Model Resource Control**: GPU allocation, batch size optimization, and memory management across different backends

**Limitations:**
- No comprehensive API rate limiting system beyond basic timeout controls
- Limited built-in sandboxing (relies on external containerization)
- Advanced cost tracking requires external service integration
- Security model depends on external infrastructure providers
